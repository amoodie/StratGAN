This was a project that began out of an interest to educate myself on machine learning topics, in association with a [class I organized](http://andrewjmoodie.com/2018/12/machine-learning-seminar/).
The project goal was to explore subsurface uncertainty quantification through the use of GANs, and it is meant to be an exploratory analysis and thought experiment.
I have decided to open source the project so that it is available as part of my professional portfolio.

This page contains some brief explanation of the model, but omits a lot of detail.
I hope to detail the model in a manuscript in the future. 

## Abstract
Subsurface reservoir size estimates involve considerable uncertainty, which impacts the quality of  reserve size and valuation models.
Conventional rules-based and process-based numerical models are useful to model this uncertainty, but involve simplifying assumptions about depositional environments and reservoir geology that may be poorly constrained.
Generative adversarial neural networks (GANs) are a machine learning model that is optimized to produce synthetic data that are indistinguishable from an arbitrary training dataset, and are an attractive tool for modeling subsurface reservoirs.
We have developed a generative adversarial network that is trained on laboratory experimental stratigraphy and produces realizations of basin-scale reservoir geology, while honoring ground-truth well log data. 
In this way, StratGAN reduces subsurface uncertainty through a large sampling of realistic potential rock geometries throughout a reservoir, without any a priori assumptions about the geology.
StratGAN couples a deep-convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) with an image quilting algorithm to scale up channel-scale realizations of reservoir geometries to basin-scale realizations.


## Model description
The model is a deep-convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) that has been trained on laboratory experiment data. 
I use custom `tensorflow` implementations of convolutional layers and dense layers, which include my flexible batch normalization operation.
The GAN is trained on patches cropped out of slices from the Tulane Delta Basin 10-1 experiment.

## Demonstration of workflow

Patches from the GAN are at approximately the channel scale, where black pixels represent channel, and white is non-channel.

I have implemented Efros-Freeman minimum-cost-boundary image quilting, which stiches together the patches from the GAN (channel scale) to make a single realization at the basin scale. 
The patches fed to the E-F algorithm are optimized via conditional inpainting methods (e.g., Dupont et al., 2018) to match along the quilting overlap, as well as at any ground-truth data (e.g., cores).

Together, this method optimizes for the best patch possible, then identifies the best path for cut-and-pasting in the image quilting stage.
I have produced routines to include ground-truth data in the basin scale realizations, such as vertical core-logs that record channel and non-channel intervals.

*Figure 3: Example of ground-truthed realizations. Top panel has finer intervals of channel bodies in the core logs. This demonstrates the variability of realizations from the model.*

We can produce an ensemble of \~100 realizations from the model, and average the samples to produce a static image, quantifying the expected probability of reservoir presence at any location.

*Figure 4: Ensemble average realization for bottom panel in Figure 3, darker color indicates higher probability of reservoir presence.*

Going one step further, we can query the size of the reservoir connected to a specific channel interval in a core log (red dashed line in Figure 4).
This analysis gives a low-side-high-side estimate of reservoir size.

*Figure 4: Quantification of probability of reservoir size at red dashed box in Figure 4. We can quantify p10, p50, p90 estimates to give a low-side-high-side estimate of reservoir size.*

The model is a proof-of-concept for using GANs in subsurface uncertainty quantification.
